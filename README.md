# SKU Inventory Prediction using Prophet
I am trying to predict the demand for an SKU being sold on an ecommerce website based on history of sales as well as other external factors such as weather and holidays. 
Currently, the data is being preprocessed to deal with missing dates for every SKU as well as reformatting the data in such a way that each day is stored column-wise and the sales of each SKU is row-wise, grouped by every unique SKU in the dataset.
